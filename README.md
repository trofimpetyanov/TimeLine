## Overview

The goal of the project is to develop an application that provides a visual timeline of Russian history, presenting significant historical events in a chronological format. The app aims to serve as an educational tool, enriching the user's understanding of Russian history through detailed descriptions, illustrations, and contextual information about each event.

### Project Objectives

1. Analyze individual events in Russian history.
2. Select key events based on the "Concept of Teaching Russian History" document by the Ministry of Education and Science.
3. Gather detailed information on the chosen events.
4. Develop an interactive application to present this information.

## Features

- **Chronological Timeline of Events**: The app opens to a main screen where all major events in Russian history are listed in chronological order. Users can scroll through the timeline from ancient times to the present, selecting periods of interest.
- **Event Details**: Each card on the timeline displays brief information—year and title. By tapping on a card, users can access a detailed description of the event, illustrations, its impact on the formation of the Russian state, and the ruler at the time of the event.
- **Ruler Section**: A dedicated section lists all rulers from the Rurik dynasty to modern times. Users can filter rulers by century to explore their reign in the context of that period.
- **Integration with Wikipedia**: For those interested in a deeper dive, the app provides links to relevant Wikipedia pages for more comprehensive information about each ruler.
