# TimeLine (Лента Времени РФ)

TimeLine is an educational tool designed to make learning Russian history accessible and engaging. It allows users to immerse themselves in the most significant events in chronological order, providing a visualized timeline of Russian historical events.

## 📚 Overview

The goal of the project is to develop an application that provides a visual timeline of Russian history, presenting significant historical events in a chronological format. The app aims to serve as an educational tool, enriching the user's understanding of Russian history through detailed descriptions, illustrations, and contextual information about each event.

### 🎯 Project Objectives

1. Analyze individual events in Russian history.
2. Select key events based on the "Concept of Teaching Russian History" document by the Ministry of Education and Science.
3. Gather detailed information on the chosen events.
4. Develop an interactive application to present this information.

This project was completed as part of the course "Fundamentals of Russian Statehood".

## ✨ Features
